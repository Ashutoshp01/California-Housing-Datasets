# California-Housing-Datasets

Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict housing prices in California based on various features from a dataset. The goal is to create an accurate model that can estimate housing prices using historical data.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
scripts/: Includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
models/: Saved machine learning models and related files.
README.md: This file.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about housing attributes and prices in California. It includes features such as:

longitude: Longitude coordinate
latitude: Latitude coordinate
housing_median_age: Median age of the houses
total_rooms: Total number of rooms
total_bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms
population: Population in the neighborhood
households: Number of households
median_income: Median income of the households
median_house_value: Target variable - median house value
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/california-housing-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd california-housing-price-prediction
